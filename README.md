This is similar to BJA-3. Here are the main differences between the two versions:

Complex class:

New constructor: Complex(double a, double b) was added. This allows creating Complex numbers directly from double values, improving usability.
toString() method changes:

Original: Used null check for imag (if (imag == null))
New: Checks if imag.num is negative or zero, providing more precise output formatting.



Rational class:

Constructor Rational(int m, int n):

New version adds check for negative denominator: if (n < 0) { m = -m; n = -n; }
Uses Math.abs(m) in GCD calculation to handle negative numerators correctly.


String constructor Rational(String s):

New version adds trim() to remove leading/trailing whitespace.
Handles mixed numbers (e.g., "1 1/2") more robustly.
Adds logic to ensure denominator is always positive.


double constructor Rational(double d):

Both versions are similar, but new version might handle edge cases better due to changes in other methods.


toString() method:

New version handles improper fractions by converting to mixed numbers.
Ensures proper formatting for whole numbers, fractions, and mixed numbers.


Utility class:

findGCD method remains the same in both versions.


Overall structure and error handling:

New version combines all classes in one file, which can be easier for small projects but less maintainable for larger ones.
Error handling is more consistent in the new version, particularly for parsing strings and handling negative numbers.


Import statements:

New version includes java.util.*, suggesting it might use additional utility classes (though not evident in the provided code).


Additional nuances:

The new Rational class handles edge cases better, such as "-0" representations.
It provides more consistent behavior across different input types (int, double, String).
The Complex class in the new version always initializes the imaginary part, even if not provided (using new Rational() instead of null).



These changes collectively make the new version more robust, consistent, and capable of handling a wider range of inputs and scenarios. It shows a more thoughtful approach to number representation and error handling, particularly for rational and complex numbers.
